If running Mac OSX, you can download the updated jnilib from here, but it is also included in the lib folder of this project:

(source: http://blog.iharder.net/2009/08/18/rxtx-java-6-and-librxtxserial-jnilib-on-intel-mac-os-x/)

This will fix the unspecified linker error if you use the lib from the RXTXComm website.
