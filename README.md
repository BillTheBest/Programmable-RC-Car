Programmable-RC-Car
===================

Arduino + $9 RC Car + $9 Parts = Programmable RC Car  

Any RC car can be hacked and made programmable.  
This project is great for electronics beginners and requires some soldering to build a 
simple Arduino shield used to control the car.  Pulse width modulation (PWM) is used for 
speed control.
